# PI Calculation
Over the past few days, I have learned different methods for calculating PI, and have implemented a few into demos for those who are as curious as I am to experiment with!
Go to [this page](http://john-jelatis.github.io/calculating-pi/) and you can see a list of those that I've uploaded, and if you know of any other ways to find pi, go ahead and lemme know, this is fascinating to me.
